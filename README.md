# Adam and Chloe's Cider Blog

A blog dedicated to our adventures trailing the world and tasting different ciders.

## Running this

This project was produced with the Spark framework and uses the Lombok plugin; for which you will need to have if,
for whatever reason, you would like to clone this and run it.

### IntelliJ

Once the plugin has been set up and the project has been imported with gradle. All you need to do is run the
Application.java file (right click, run).

### Gradlew

For this, all you need to do is go to the main directory in Git Bash and run './gradlew build'

## My TODO list

1) Hook up DAO objects to actual postgres database. Will likely be PhpMyAdmin because...thats what I have on Digital Ocean
2) Make front page look better
3) Make it so images can be of any type. Currently only .jpg's will work. As I have literally appended that to the end of each.
4) Change image size on 'one cider' page. As it is currently too big. Or look into other blogs and follow suit.
5) incorporate multiple images on 'one cider' page.
6) incorporate breaks in text for reviews, seperated by images. This and the one above may simply evolve to incorporating someone
elses work in a sense. Why reinvent the wheel...
7) Add messages/comments to the bottom.
8) Add ability to add reviews.
